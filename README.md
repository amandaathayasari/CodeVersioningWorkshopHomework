Homework Assignment

**Summary**

I learn about how to utilize git to make a version control.
The basic would be 
git init
git add
git commit, etc.

**Challenge faced during assignment**

1. When I tried to use git rebase --onto experiment main, there's a conflict
2. I can not click the folder assignment in github

**How I overcame**

1. I use git rebase --abort

Need advice from suhu if any.

2. Unsolved, but I can access it in my local
